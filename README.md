Tools, APIs, 3D models, target images &amp; test code for building a prototype interactive AR treasure hunt

I am trying to create a small AR activity for the festival but I only have a month turn around time - here’s the pitch:

similarly to your Earth-based pick-‘em-up game - 
The idea is that visitors use iPhones
to hunt for  ALIEN creatures (made in nifty 3D scanning app “TRNIO”) [[I have contacted the developer of this app and he’s totally up 4 doing this!]] 
hidden around the festival site (using GPS location app “TORCH”). 
Punters will then see the Alien disappear into a cryogenic TANK 
and the have to return them to their home PLANETS - in each case a different throbbing bobbing SPHERE 
(which plays weird gobbledygook alien languages)  
suspended in the trees or around the buildings and stages of the ISIS farmhouse tavern on the THAMES in OXFORD.  

After each successfully returned ESCAPEE/TOURIST/SPY creature, the speakers play a little cheer or jeer depending on if it was a good idea!

Do you think you’d have some TIME to help make this?  It’s a simple design and it’d be such fun for people to PLAY!!!
